# Plain HTML Sample for Deploy Now

This is a plain HTML website. You can use it as a starting point for your project or to give [Deploy Now](https://www.ionos.com/hosting/deploy-now) a try.

## How to deploy it 

1. [Sign in or sign up](https://ionos.space/sign-up) for Deploy Now
2. Click this button and name your new repo

   [![Deploy to IONOS](https://images.ionos.space/deploy-now-icons/deploy-to-ionos-btn.svg)](https://ionos.space/setup?repo=https://github.com/ionos-deploy-now/hello-plain-html)

3. Deploy Now will detect necessary build dependencies and commands. You can adjust them and add environment variables.

Afterwards, Deploy Now will set up a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow that will be triggered by every new code commit. Your project is automatically deployed to IONOS infrastructure. Projects go live under a preview URL, but you can replace it with a custom domain anytime.
